Once upon a time, in a land far, far away...
There's a white rabbit, it's hunting the lion.
The rabbit moved swiftly through the tall grass, its eyes locked on the lion's shadow.
The rabbit's heart raced, each leap drawing it closer, its sharp gaze fixed on the shifting silhouette of the mighty predator, unaware of the impending strike.
